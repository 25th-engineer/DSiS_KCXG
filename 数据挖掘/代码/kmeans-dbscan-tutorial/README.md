# kmeans-dbscan-tutorial
A clustering tutorial with **scikit-learn** for beginners.

## Contents
1. Introduction to **k-means**, **k-means++** and **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering Algorithm with Noise)**.

2. Explore common drawbacks of k-means, such as:
  - Need to choose the right number of clusters.
  - Cannot handle Noise Data and Outliers.
  - Cannot handle Non-spherical Data.
And of course, present solutions for the above drawbacks.

3. Introduction to supervised and unsupervised methods for measuring cluster quality such as homogeneity, completeness and the Silhouette Coefficient (part of section 2).

4. Two simple exercises (k-means & DBSCAN) along with the tutorial.
